# SpyGame: Development TODO & Backlog

*Last updated: Day 1 (7/25)*

## üöÄ Critical Path (Hackathon Priority)

### **Team Member 1 (Strong Python)** - Game Master & Backend
- [ ] Implement GameMaster agent with core tools (`submit_clue`, `submit_guess`, `get_current_board_state`)
- [ ] Implement shared session state management
- [ ] Set up agent integration within ADK framework
- [ ] Basic end-to-end game simulation script

### **Team Member 2 (Intermediate Python)** - Operative & UI  
- [ ] Implement Operative agent with LLM integration
- [ ] Game Master text output formatting (based on MVP_Interface.md)
- [ ] Operative prompt engineering (collaborate with Team Member 3)

### **Team Member 3 (Prompt Engineer)** - Spymaster & Strategy
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY: Spymaster prompt engineering** 
- [ ] Develop test scenarios for agent validation
- [ ] Iterate on Spymaster LLM prompts for clue generation
- [ ] Analyze game logs and provide feedback on agent performance

## üìã Implementation Backlog

### **Core Functionality (Must Have)**
- [ ] Basic clue constraint enforcement (not on board, single word, etc.)
- [ ] IEEE competition scoring implementation
- [ ] Win/loss condition detection (all red found, assassin hit, all blue revealed)
- [ ] Basic N-guess logic for Operative (skip N+1 initially)

### **Enhanced Features (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] N+1 guess logic for Operative
- [ ] Advanced risk assessment for Spymaster
- [ ] Cross-game memory/learning
- [ ] Performance optimization

## üßπ Cleanup & Polish Tasks

### **Code Cleanup**
- [ ] **Review prototype agents**: `telephone_game.py` and `day_trip.py` 
  - *Keep for now as pattern reference, remove before final submission*
- [ ] Remove any debug/test code from main agents
- [ ] Code review and refactoring after core functionality works

### **Documentation Review**
- [ ] **Final documentation pass** - ensure all docs reflect actual implementation
- [ ] Update EXPLANATION.md with any implementation discoveries
- [ ] Create DEMO.md with video link and timestamps
- [ ] Review all docs for consistency and accuracy

### **Testing & Validation**
- [ ] Comprehensive game simulation runs
- [ ] Performance metric collection
- [ ] Edge case testing (malformed LLM responses, etc.)
- [ ] CI/CD validation in production environment

## üîç Technical Debt & Known Issues

### **Current Shortcuts (Document for Later)**
- Using simplified word list initially (not full Codenames‚Ñ¢ vocabulary)
- Basic prompt templates (will need iteration based on performance)
- Minimal error handling (enhance after core functionality)

### **Monitoring & Analysis**
- [ ] LLM response quality tracking
- [ ] Agent decision effectiveness analysis
- [ ] Game outcome pattern identification

## üìà Success Metrics Tracking

### **Competition Metrics**
- [ ] Average turns to win
- [ ] Win rate percentage  
- [ ] Assassin avoidance rate
- [ ] Clue effectiveness (intended vs. actual guesses)

## üö® Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] All agents functional and tested
- [ ] Clean up prototype files (`telephone_game.py`, `day_trip.py`)
- [ ] Documentation accuracy review
- [ ] Video demo recorded and linked in DEMO.md
- [ ] Final code cleanup and comments
- [ ] Test submission in clean environment

**Note**: Focus on critical path items first. Backlog and cleanup items only after core functionality is working!
