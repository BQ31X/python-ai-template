# SpyGame Development Journal

*Track development progress, screenshots, and key discoveries*

## Day 1 (July 25, 2024)

### Morning: Infrastructure Setup ✅
- **Time**: 12:00-16:00 EDT
- **Focus**: Agent framework, testing, documentation
- **Key Achievements**:
  - All agents registered and working (telephone, day_trip, spymaster, operative, gamemaster)
  - Comprehensive testing framework (`test_agents.py`, `TEST.sh`, CI/CD)
  - Professional documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, EXPLANATION.md, MVP_Interface.md)
  - IP-compliant branding (SpyGame, Codenames™)

### Evening: Agent Testing & Prompt Engineering Prep
- **Time**: 16:00+ EDT
- **Focus**: Understanding current agent behavior, preparing for prompt engineering

#### Agent Baseline Testing
**OperativeAgent Test** (Screenshot: [`day1-operative-baseline.png`](../screenshots/day1-operative-baseline.png))
- **Input**: "words: bat, frog, perspective. clue: jumping number: 2"
- **Response**: Connected "jumping" to "frog" and "bat" (baseball reference)
- **Quality**: Good semantic reasoning, structured thinking
- **Notes**: Solid baseline - prompt engineering will enhance this significantly

**SpymasterAgent Test** (Screenshot: [`day1-spymaster-baseline.png`](../screenshots/day1-spymaster-baseline.png))
- **Input**: "give me a clue for bat, frog, and perspective"
- **Response**: "Clue: JUMP 2" with explanation acknowledging it doesn't work for perspective
- **Current Status**: **Strong baseline** - Smart semantic clustering (bat+frog=jumping), honest constraint handling, strategic 2/3 word solution  
- **Quality**: Both SpyMaster and Operative followed same reasoning path, showing good agent coordination
- **Next**: Refinement and optimization rather than major overhaul - system fundamentals are working well

**GameMasterAgent Test** (Screenshot: [`day1-gamemaster-baseline.png`](../screenshots/day1-gamemaster-baseline.png))
- **Input**: "what can you do?"  
- **Response**: Comprehensive list of game orchestration capabilities (rule enforcement, state tracking, etc.)
- **Current Status**: Surprisingly sophisticated understanding of role, well-structured response
- **Next**: Implementation of actual game logic and tools - prompting is already strong

### Late Evening: Testing Infrastructure Enhancement ✅
- **Time**: 19:00+ EDT
- **Focus**: Competition-ready testing tools and team coordination

#### Major Infrastructure Additions
**Competition-Ready Word Pool** (`shared_word_pool.py`)
- **250 diverse words** covering IEEE competition requirements
- **Categories**: 120 standard + 70 pop culture + 30 slang + 30 technical
- **Examples**: BATMAN, HOGWARTS, MEME, BLOCKCHAIN - handles unknown vocabulary
- **Team Benefit**: Both Spymaster and Operative developers use identical vocabulary

**Enhanced Testing Tool** (`spymaster_tester.py`)
- **Risk-aware scenario generation**: Different word types (opponent, civilian, assassin)
- **Game state simulation**: `--early-game`, `--mid-game`, `--late-game` pressure scenarios
- **Flexible arguments**: `--red/--target`, `--blue/--opponent`, `--neutral/--civilian`
- **Operative format**: Dual output with evaluation context + clean agent input

#### Team Coordination Breakthrough
**Operative Testing Solution**
- **Problem**: Operative developer needs word scenarios without category spoilers
- **Solution**: `python spymaster_tester.py -o` generates:
  * "FOR EVALUATION" - shows red/blue/neutral for human judgment
  * "FOR OPERATIVE AGENT" - clean word list + sample clue for agent input
- **Impact**: Perfect coordination between Spymaster and Operative development

**Documentation Reorganization**
- **Scalable structure**: `docs/testing/` with agent testing vs prompt testing separation
- **Future-proof**: Space for integration testing, performance testing
- **Judge-friendly**: Clear testing overview for submission requirements

### Key Discoveries
- **ADK Web Interface**: Professional, judge-friendly presentation
- **Agent Instructions**: Even basic prompts yield reasonable responses
- **Development Efficiency**: Text-based interface allows focus on AI reasoning
- **Competition Vocabulary Challenge**: IEEE uses unknown words (slang, pop culture) - our 250-word pool simulates this
- **Dual Testing Needs**: Spymaster needs risk awareness, Operative needs clean input without spoilers
- **Team Readiness**: Infrastructure complete, shared vocabulary established, teammates can start coordinated coding

### Next Steps (Evening/Tomorrow)
1. **Spymaster Prompt Engineering** (Team Member 3 priority)
2. **GameMaster Implementation** (Team Member 1)
3. **Operative Refinement** (Team Member 2)
4. **Multi-agent Integration Testing**
